A Megastar's Mantras
--------------------
(Things that Mean a Lot to Me)

A is for Australia
The land I adore;
It's so spotless and clean
You can eat off the floor.

B is for Boomerang,
Which our quaint Abos launch
In the hope it will bring back
A roast quokka's haunch.

C is for Culture
Which blossoms unchecked,
You can't move in my homeland
for Beckett and Brecht.
